"Here in this project It implements merge sort algorithm which sort the elements in specific order."
Merge Sort algorithm --- **DIVIDE AND CONQUER**
                                      --- Array is divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.
                                      ---It is a recursive algorithm
                                      ---Merge Sort is efficient algorithm interms of time when compared with insertion sort
Tools Used:
                 ----Visual studio code
                 ---Install python Extensions

To run the code follow the below steps:
                  a) we need to create  20 files 
                  b)we need to sort numbers from the generated files
                  c) Run code
                  d) The output will be generated in the form of total elements, total comparisions, total time taken for sorting
